# Failing GitHub Action check

By default, Lost Pixel does not exit the action with a non-zero exit code when there is a failing lost-pixel run(**differences found** ‚ùå), but you can easily configure it.\
\
In [lostpixel.config.js|ts](../setup/project-configuration/) add the following config value:

```
...
failOnDifference: true,
...
```
