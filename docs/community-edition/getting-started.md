# Getting started

To add visual regression testing to your project you need two things:

* storybook that holds stories to be tested
* lost-pixel configuration file

1. &#x20;Follow this [guide by storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install) to add it to your project
2. Add lost-pixel [configuration file](../setup/project-configuration.md)

After writing your first stories you can adopt the visual regression testing by following _semi-manual_ workflow
